Contributing
============

> Before contributing please read this file thoroughly

To contribute, create a branch by using `git checkout -b branch-name` where branch name is a descriptive name that explains your changes to the code. Once you have made your code changes switch back to the master branch `git checkout master` then do a `git pull --rebase` to sync all changes. Now, you are ready to create your pull request!
